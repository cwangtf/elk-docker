These are famous quotes by William Shakespeare:
All that glitters is not gold
To thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man.
Hell is empty and all the devils are here.
Brevity is the soul of wit.
By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes. Open, locks, Whoever knocks!
These violent delights have violent ends...
Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.
Glendower: I can call spirits from the vasty deep. Hotspur: Why, so can I, or so can any man; But will they come when you do call for them?
If music be the food of love, play on.
There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.
